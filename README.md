    You can also search for games or view a list of all multiplayer or co-op games that are available to play with others. Games can be clicked on to view a description of the game and from that page you can create or join a lobby for that game. 


**7. How did you use AI or any API’s?**

Tell us exactly what services and products you used and how you used them. Be very specific.
We used:

For AI we used the gemini generative language 1.5 flash, which gave a free api key upon sign up. We used this by setting function with the pre extisitng prompt `Tell me a fun fact or joke about "${topic}"` which takes in a stringfied json object representing the users input and pastes the respones in the front end. 

For video game API RAWG.io which was a free api key upon making a account and registering the reason use of the API key. We used the API key to get details about video games for the background animation and a video game catalog.
